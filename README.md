# Eurowings
Subscription to a Newsletter
##Description
This project developed as a test for Eurowings. Its main duties are:
-tell you that someone subscribed to your newsletter or un-subscribed,
-ask you if a given user should receive the newsletter, or not.
And the bonuses are:
-Add another REST endpoint to list all users that subscribed before and/or after a given date.
-If your choice of technology allows it, make your service stateless, and persist the data to an (in-memory) database for easy testing.
